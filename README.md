### Processing Scripts (PyQGIS) by Germ√°n Carrillo

 - **Export_Composers_of_Multiple_Projects.py**

   This script allows you to export the composers of all the QGIS projects that are inside a base folder.
   It's based on the 'Maps Printer' plugin by [Harrissou Sant-anna](https://github.com/DelazJ), which is required to run the script.

 - **Atlas_Neighbor_Pages.py**

   This script calculates neighbor (right, left, above, below) grid cells (pages) to include them as labels in Atlas current page.
   See original question at GIS.SE: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/214300/how-to-determine-neighbouring-tile-ids-in-qgis
